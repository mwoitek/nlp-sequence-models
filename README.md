nlp-sequence-models
===================

This repo contains some code I wrote as I was learning NLP. To complete an
on-line course on NLP with sequence models, I had to finish 4 programming
assignments. The links to the Jupyter notebooks with my solution to the
corresponding problems can be found here:

* [Sentiment with Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-sequence-models/blob/master/week_1/C3_W1_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Deep N-grams](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-sequence-models/blob/master/week_2/C3_W2_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-sequence-models/blob/master/week_3/C3_W3_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Question Duplicates](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-sequence-models/blob/master/week_4/C3_W4_Assignment.ipynb)
