nlp-sequence-models
===================

This repo contains some code I wrote as I was learning NLP. To complete an
on-line course on NLP with sequence models, I had to finish 4 programming
assignments. The links to the Jupyter notebooks with my solution to the
corresponding problems can be found here:

* Sentiment with Deep Neural Networks.
* Deep N-grams.
* Named Entity Recognition (NER).
* Question Duplicates.
